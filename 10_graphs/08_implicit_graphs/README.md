## 📐 Mathematical Foundations

### 1️⃣ Definition: Implicit Graph

**Definition:** An implicit graph $G = (V, E)$ is one where:

- Vertices $V$ are not explicitly enumerated

- Edges $E$ are derived from problem constraints/rules

- Graph structure emerges from entity relationships

**Formal Construction:**

```math
G_{implicit} = (V, E) \text{ where } V = f(\text{input}), E = g(\text{rules})

```

**Example (Jump Game):**

- Input: Array $A = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]$

- $V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ (indices)

- $E = \{(i, j) : j \leq i + A[i]\}$ (jump rules)

---

### 2️⃣ Reachability in Implicit Graphs

**Theorem:** For array-based implicit graph, reachability from $s$ to $t$ can be determined in $O(n)$ time.

**Proof:**

1. Graph has $|V| = n$ vertices (array indices)

2. Each vertex has at most $n$ outgoing edges

3. $|E| \leq n^2$ worst case

4. BFS/DFS: $O(|V| + |E|) = O(n + n^2) = O(n^2)$

5. With greedy optimization (Jump Game): $O(n)$ ∎

**Reachability Set:**

```math
\text{Reach}(s) = \{v \in V : \exists \text{ path } s \rightsquigarrow v\}

```

---

### 3️⃣ Shortest Path in Unweighted Implicit Graphs

**Theorem:** BFS finds shortest path in unweighted implicit graph.

**Proof:**

- Let $d(v)$ = distance from source to $v$

- BFS visits vertices in order of increasing $d(v)$

- When $v$ is dequeued, $d(v)$ is optimal

- No shorter path can exist (contradicts BFS property) ∎

**Distance Formula:**

```math
d(u, v) = \min\{k : \exists \text{ path of length } k \text{ from } u \text{ to } v\}

```

---

### 4️⃣ Connected Components in Grid Graphs

**Theorem:** Grid with $m \times n$ cells has at most $\lceil \frac{mn}{2} \rceil$ components.

**Proof:**

- Each component needs ≥ 2 cells (or isolated)

- Minimum component size = 1
- Maximum components = $mn$ (all isolated)

- Adjacent cells reduce count

- Checkerboard pattern gives $\lceil \frac{mn}{2} \rceil$ ∎

**Component Definition:**

```math
C_i = \{v \in V : v \text{ is reachable from seed } s_i\}
V = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} C_i, \quad C_i \cap C_j = \emptyset \text{ for } i \neq j

```

---

### 5️⃣ Topological Sort Existence

**Theorem:** Topological sort exists ⟺ Graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

**Proof (⟸):**

- If DAG, no cycles exist

- Pick vertex with in-degree 0
- Remove and repeat

- Always possible (no cycle to block) ∎

**Proof (⟹):**

- Assume topo sort exists but cycle exists

- Let cycle: $v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k \to v_1$

- In topo order: $v_1$ before $v_2$ before ... before $v_k$ before $v_1$

- Contradiction: $v_1$ both before and after itself ∎

**Topological Order:**

```math
\forall (u, v) \in E : \text{pos}(u) < \text{pos}(v)

```

---

### 6️⃣ State Space Size

**Theorem:** For state space $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)$ with domains $D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_k$:

```math

|\text{States}| = \prod_{i=1}^{k} |D_i|

```

**Example (Sliding Puzzle 2×3):**

- States = permutations of 6 positions

- $|\text{States}| = 6! = 720$

- With constraints (e.g., parity): $\frac{6!}{2} = 360$

**State Transition Graph:**

```math
E = \{(s, s') : s' \text{ reachable from } s \text{ by one move}\}

```

---

### 7️⃣ Multi-Source BFS Optimality

**Theorem:** Multi-source BFS finds minimum distance to ANY source.

**Proof:**

- Initialize all sources with $d = 0$

- Standard BFS from virtual super-source

- Each vertex $v$ gets $d(v) = \min_{s \in S} d(s, v)$

- BFS guarantees optimality for each source ∎

**Multi-source Distance:**

```math
d_{multi}(v) = \min_{s \in S} d(s, v)

```

## 🎓 Pattern Recognition Guide

### Quick Recognition Framework

**Step 1: Identify Entities**

- Array problem? → Indices are vertices

- Grid problem? → Cells are vertices

- String problem? → States/words are vertices

- Scheduling? → Tasks are vertices

**Step 2: Find Relationships**

- Can move from i to j? → Edge (i,j)

- Adjacent cells? → Edge between cells

- Transform w1 to w2? → Edge (w1,w2)

- Dependency a→b? → Directed edge

**Step 3: Match Problem Type**

- "Can reach?" → Reachability (DFS/BFS)

- "Minimum steps?" → Shortest path (BFS)

- "Count groups?" → Components (DFS/Union-Find)

- "Valid order?" → Topological sort

- "Has cycle?" → Cycle detection

## 💭 Common Interview Questions

**Q: How do I know if a problem is secretly a graph?**  
A: Ask yourself: "Are there entities with relationships?" If yes, it's likely a graph. Look for words like "reach", "connect", "transform", "order", "group".

**Q: When should I use BFS vs DFS?**  
A: 

- **BFS** for shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-by-level exploration, minimum steps

- **DFS** for existence checks, all paths, cycle detection, easier to implement with recursion

**Q: Why didn't I recognize this was a graph problem?**  
A: Because problem never said "graph"! Practice the 3-question framework: (1) What are entities? (2) How related? (3) What am I finding?

**Q: Jump Game looks like DP to me. Why graph?**  
A: It CAN be solved with DP, but recognizing it as a graph (reachability) often leads to simpler, more intuitive solutions. Both viewpoints are valid!

**Q: How do I practice recognition?**  
A: For each problem, BEFORE solving, write down: "Vertices = ___", "Edges = ___", "Problem type = ___". This builds pattern recognition muscle.

**Q: I keep using DFS for shortest path and getting wrong answer. Why?**  
A: DFS doesn't guarantee shortest path! It might find a longer path first. Always use BFS for unweighted shortest path.

**Q: When do I need Union-Find vs DFS?**  
A: Union-Find is optimal for:

- Dynamic connectivity (edges added over time)

- Counting components efficiently

- Kruskal's MST
Use DFS when you need to explore the actual structure.

**Q: Array problem or graph problem - how to decide?**  
A: If the problem involves relationships between indices/values, think graph. Pure computation (sum, max) is usually just array manipulation.

**Q: What if I can't build the full graph (too large)?**  
A: That's implicit graphs! You don't build it. Generate edges on-the-fly during BFS/DFS. Example: Word Ladder generates neighbors during search.

**Q: How many graph problems should I solve?**  
A: For interviews: 30-40 problems covering all patterns. Use the roadmap above.

## 💡 Key Insights

> **Recognition is 80% of the solution!**  
> Once you see the graph, the algorithm becomes obvious.

**The Hidden Graph Principle:**

```
Problem without "graph" keywords + Relationships = Hidden Graph

```

**Universal Recognition Questions:**

1. What are the entities? → **Vertices**

2. How are they related? → **Edges**

3. What am I finding? → **Algorithm**

**Master These Core Patterns:**

- 🎯 Array indices → Reachability/Shortest path

- 🌊 Grid cells → Components/BFS

- 🔤 Strings → Transformations

- 📊 Dependencies → Topological sort/Cycle detection

- 👥 Grouping → Union-Find/Components

- 🎮 States → State space search
