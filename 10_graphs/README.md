## 📐 Mathematical Foundation

### 1️⃣ Graph Definition

$$G = (V, E)$$

- $V$: Set of vertices (nodes)
- $E$: Set of edges $\subseteq V \times V$

---

### 2️⃣ Graph Properties

| Property | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Directed** | Edges have direction: $(u, v) \neq (v, u)$ |
| **Undirected** | Edges are symmetric: $(u, v) = (v, u)$ |
| **Weighted** | Edges have weights: $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ |
| **Connected** | Path exists between any two vertices |
| **Acyclic** | No cycles exist |

---

### 3️⃣ Degree

**Undirected graph:**

$$\deg(v) = |\{e \in E : v \in e\}|$$

**Handshaking Lemma:**

$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$$

**Directed graph:**

$$\text{in-deg}(v) + \text{out-deg}(v) = \text{total degree}$$

---

### 4️⃣ Space Complexity

| Representation | Space | Edge Lookup | Iterate Neighbors |
|----------------|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
| Adjacency Matrix | O(V²) | O(1) | O(V) |
| Adjacency List | O(V+E) | O(deg) | O(deg) |
| Edge List | O(E) | O(E) | O(E) |

---

### 5️⃣ BFS Complexity

$$\boxed{T = O(V + E), \quad S = O(V)}$$

**Proof:** Each vertex enqueued once, each edge examined once.

---

### 6️⃣ DFS Complexity

$$\boxed{T = O(V + E), \quad S = O(V)}$$

**Space:** O(V) for recursion stack in worst case.

---

### 7️⃣ Shortest Path Algorithms

| Algorithm | Graph Type | Time | Space |
|-----------|------------|:----:|:-----:|
| BFS | Unweighted | O(V+E) | O(V) |
| Dijkstra | Non-negative weights | O((V+E) log V) | O(V) |
| Bellman-Ford | Any weights | O(VE) | O(V) |
| Floyd-Warshall | All pairs | O(V³) | O(V²) |

---

### 8️⃣ Dijkstra's Correctness

**Relaxation:**

$$\text{dist}[v] = \min(\text{dist}[v], \text{dist}[u] + w(u,v))$$

**Invariant:** When vertex $u$ is extracted from priority queue, $\text{dist}[u]$ is optimal.

---

### 9️⃣ Bellman-Ford

**Detects negative cycles:**

$$\text{If any relaxation after } V-1 \text{ iterations} \Rightarrow \text{negative cycle}$$

---

### 🔟 Topological Sort

**Exists iff graph is DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).**

**Kahn's Algorithm:** Process vertices with in-degree 0.

$$\text{Order: } v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \text{ where } (v_i, v_j) \in E \Rightarrow i < j$$

## 💡 Key Insights & Pro Tips

> **🎯 BFS vs DFS:** BFS for shortest path (unweighted). DFS for connectivity, cycles, topological sort!

> **⚡ Adjacency List > Matrix:** O(V+E) vs O(V²) for sparse graphs. Use list unless dense!

> **🔄 Union-Find = Connectivity:** For "are these connected?" or cycle detection, Union-Find is O(α(n)) ≈ O(1)!

> **📊 Dijkstra Needs Non-Negative:** Negative weights? Use Bellman-Ford! All pairs? Floyd-Warshall!

> **🌊 Multi-Source BFS:** Multiple starting points? Add all to queue initially, run BFS once!

## 🎖️ Interview Success Tips

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Use adjacency matrix for sparse graphs (O(V²) space!)
- Forget to track visited nodes (infinite loops!)
- Use Dijkstra with negative weights (wrong results!)
- Confuse directed vs undirected graphs
- Forget to check if graph is connected

✅ **Do:**
- Choose right representation: adjacency list for sparse
- Always track visited to avoid cycles
- Know when to use each shortest path algorithm
- Handle edge cases: disconnected graphs, self-loops
- Master both BFS and DFS thoroughly

### Optimization Checklist

```
[ ] Is the graph sparse? Use adjacency list!
[ ] Need shortest path? Unweighted→BFS, Weighted→Dijkstra!
[ ] Have negative weights? Use Bellman-Ford!
[ ] Checking connectivity? Union-Find is O(α(n))!
[ ] Need ordering? Use topological sort on DAG!
[ ] Detecting cycles? DFS with coloring!
[ ] Multiple starting points? Multi-source BFS!
```
