# 🔗 Prefix-Suffix Matching with KMP

## 📊 Visual Overview

![Prefix-Suffix Matching](./images/prefix-suffix.svg)

## 📊 Metadata

- **Difficulty:** ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange)

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

- **Pattern:** Border Analysis, Symmetric Properties

---

## 🎯 Overview

Prefix-suffix matching problems involve finding strings that are both prefixes and suffixes (borders). KMP's failure function directly solves these problems.

---

## 📐 Mathematical Foundation

### Border Definition

**Border** of string s: A string that is both a proper prefix and suffix of s.

```
String: "ABCAB"
Borders: "", "AB"
Longest proper border: "AB" (length 2)

```

### Happy Prefix

**Happy prefix:** A prefix that is also a suffix (proper, not entire string).

```
"level" → "l" is happy prefix
"ababab" → "ab", "abab" are happy prefixes

```

### Mathematical Properties

**Property 1:** All borders form a chain

```
If b₁ is border of s and b₂ is border of b₁,
then b₂ is border of s

```

**Property 2:** Number of borders

```
String of length n has at most O(log n) borders on average
Worst case: O(n) (e.g., "aaa...a")

```

## 💻 Implementations

### 1. Longest Happy Prefix

```python
def longest_happy_prefix(s):
    """
    Find longest proper prefix that is also suffix
    
    LeetCode 1392: Longest Happy Prefix

    Returns: The longest happy prefix string
    """
    n = len(s)
    
    if n == 0:
        return ""
    
    # Compute failure function
    pi = [0] * n
    k = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        while k > 0 and s[k] != s[i]:
            k = pi[k - 1]

        pi[i] = k
    
    # Longest happy prefix has length π[n-1]
    length = pi[n - 1]
    return s[:length]

## 💡 Applications

### 1. String Merging

```python
def merge_strings(strings):
    """
    Merge strings by finding overlaps
    
    Used in: genome assembly, text processing
    
    Time: O(n² · m) where n = number of strings, m = avg length
    """
    if not strings:
        return ""
    
    result = strings[0]
    
    for s in strings[1:]:
        # Find overlap
        overlap = max_prefix_suffix_overlap(result, s)
        # Merge
        result = result + s[overlap:]
    
    return result

# Example: DNA sequence assembly
fragments = ["GATCGA", "CGATTAC", "TACGAT"]
assembled = merge_strings(fragments)
print(f"Assembled sequence: {assembled}")

```

### 2. Palindrome Construction

```python
def min_chars_to_palindrome(s):
    """
    Minimum characters to add to end to make palindrome
    
    Time: O(n)
    """
    rev = s[::-1]
    combined = rev + '#' + s
    
    n = len(combined)
    pi = [0] * n
    k = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        while k > 0 and combined[k] != combined[i]:
            k = pi[k - 1]
        
        if combined[k] == combined[i]:
            k += 1
        
        pi[i] = k
    
    # Characters to add
    chars_to_add = len(s) - pi[n - 1]
    return s + rev[:chars_to_add]

# Example
print(min_chars_to_palindrome("abc"))    # "abcba"
print(min_chars_to_palindrome("aacecaaa"))  # "aacecaaa"

```

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **π[n-1] is Key:**
   - Gives longest happy prefix directly
   - O(1) access after O(n) preprocessing

2. **Border Chain:**
   - Follow π to enumerate all borders
   - At most O(log n) average

3. **Reverse Trick:**
   - For palindromes: use s + '#' + reverse(s)
   - π tells longest palindrome prefix

4. **Overlap Finding:**
   - Essential for string merging
   - Used in bioinformatics
