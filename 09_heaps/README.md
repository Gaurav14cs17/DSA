## 📐 Mathematical Foundation

### 1️⃣ Heap Property

**Max-Heap:**

$$\boxed{\forall i: A[\text{parent}(i)] \geq A[i]}$$

**Min-Heap:**

$$\boxed{\forall i: A[\text{parent}(i)] \leq A[i]}$$

---

### 2️⃣ Array Representation

For 0-indexed array:

$$\text{parent}(i) = \lfloor (i-1)/2 \rfloor$$

$$\text{left}(i) = 2i + 1$$

$$\text{right}(i) = 2i + 2$$

---

### 3️⃣ Height of Heap

For heap with $n$ elements:

$$\boxed{h = \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor}$$

**Proof:** Complete binary tree property.

---

### 4️⃣ Time Complexity

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|:----:|
| peek (find max/min) | O(1) |
| insert | O(log n) |
| extract max/min | O(log n) |
| heapify (build heap) | O(n) |
| increase/decrease key | O(log n) |

---

### 5️⃣ Build Heap in O(n)

**Theorem:** Building heap from array is O(n), not O(n log n).

**Proof:**

$$T(n) = \sum_{h=0}^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor} \lceil \frac{n}{2^{h+1}} \rceil \cdot O(h)$$

$$= O(n \sum_{h=0}^{\log n} \frac{h}{2^h}) = O(n \cdot 2) = O(n)$$

The sum converges to 2.

---

### 6️⃣ Heapify (Sift Down)

**Restore heap property after root change:**

$$\text{heapify}(i) = \text{swap with largest child, recurse}$$

**Time:** O(h) = O(log n)

---

### 7️⃣ Heap Sort

1. Build max-heap: O(n)
2. Extract max n times: O(n log n)

$$\boxed{T(n) = O(n \log n)}$$

**Space:** O(1) in-place

---

### 8️⃣ K-way Merge

**Problem:** Merge k sorted lists of total n elements.

**Heap approach:**

$$T(n, k) = O(n \log k)$$

Each element: insert once, extract once → 2 × O(log k).

## 🎯 Key Patterns

### Min-Heap in Python

```python
import heapq

# Min-heap (default in Python)
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 5)
heapq.heappush(heap, 3)
heapq.heappush(heap, 7)

min_val = heapq.heappop(heap)  # 3
peek = heap[0]  # 5 (next minimum)
```

### Max-Heap (Negate Values)

```python
# Max-heap using negation
max_heap = []
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -5)
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -3)
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -7)

max_val = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # 7
```

### Heap with Custom Key

```python
# Heap of tuples (priority, value)
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, (2, "task B"))
heapq.heappush(heap, (1, "task A"))
heapq.heappush(heap, (3, "task C"))

priority, task = heapq.heappop(heap)  # (1, "task A")
```

## 📊 Heap Pattern Decision

```
Heap Problem
     │
     ├── Top K smallest → Max-Heap of size k
     │
     ├── Top K largest → Min-Heap of size k
     │
     ├── Merge K sorted → Min-Heap of k elements
     │
     ├── Median stream → Two Heaps (max + min)
     │
     └── Schedule/Priority → Priority Queue
```

## 💡 Key Insights & Pro Tips

> **🎯 Top K Pattern:** K largest → Min-Heap size k. K smallest → Max-Heap size k. Always opposite!

> **⚡ Build Heap = O(n):** Not O(n log n)! Bottom-up heapify is linear time!

> **🔄 Two Heaps = Median:** Max-heap (left half) + Min-heap (right half). Balance them!

> **📊 K-way Merge:** Always O(n log k), not O(nk). Heap keeps only k elements!

> **🌊 Greedy + Heap:** Most scheduling/priority problems use greedy with heap!

## 🎖️ Interview Success Tips

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Confuse top K largest (use min-heap) with top K smallest (use max-heap)
- Think build heap is O(n log n) — it's O(n)!
- Use heap when array/quickselect is faster
- Forget to negate values for max-heap in Python
- Ignore that heappop() doesn't preserve order for ties

✅ **Do:**
- Master the "opposite heap" pattern for Top K
- Know heapify() is faster than n insertions
- Consider quickselect for one-time k-th element
- Use (priority, value) tuples for custom ordering
- Remember heap is O(1) peek, O(log n) insert/extract

### Optimization Checklist

```
[ ] Can I use heap instead of sorting? (O(n log k) vs O(n log n))
[ ] Is this a Top K problem? (Use opposite heap!)
[ ] Is this a merge K problem? (Heap of k pointers)
[ ] Do I need dynamic median? (Two heaps!)
[ ] Is this greedy + priority? (Heap for next choice)
[ ] Can I build heap once instead of repeated inserts?
```

## 🌟 Motivational Corner

> "Heap is the Swiss Army knife of interviews — Top K, merge, median, scheduling, all use heaps!"

**Progress Tracker:**
- 🥉 **Bronze:** Solve 10 heap problems + master basic operations
- 🥈 **Silver:** Solve 20 heap problems + Top K patterns
- 🥇 **Gold:** Solve 30 heap problems + merge K + two heaps
- 💎 **Platinum:** Master all patterns + advanced heaps

**Remember:** Heap operations are O(log n), but build heap is O(n)! 🚀
